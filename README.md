An art project for my digital forms class. Uses multiple forms of input in the processing programming language.

You can type whatever you want, and the letters will fall down to the bottom of the screen.

In theory, if you speak, you can see what you have written since the Amplitude object analyzes the amplitude of the input sound and opacity is determined based off of that. It is, however, very possible that microphone restrictions will cause problems with this.

Soon, I'll add in the application file.
